# Copy-from-Camera
A PowerShell script to copy images from my Nikon D5300 to a folder on the PC despite Nikon not mapping as a drive

Including optionally deleting the files from the camera after the copy
(Took ages to work this one out)

Feel free to use although I would like a credit if you publish it.
